# Particle-detect

A crowd sourcing mobile application for data labelling on the massive data for scientific purpose.

The project is initially designed to label the data from the captured image on the IV bags. 
The labeled data are supposed to learn and test the strategy for detecting particles in the IV bags.

The particles, like small piece of glass, iron or plastic, may introduced in any step to build an IV bag with medical liquid. 
For quality requirement, the current solution at Baxter is checking with experienced labors, which is expensive and unreliable.
The alternative solution is testing everything with computer vision. 
As a necessary step, we waht collect data in the captured image with true ground truth so that we could learn the model and evaluate our algorithm 

For this demand, we divide the whole question into small pieces so that we can label our data anytime, anywhere. 
For the first step, we build the task to label particle candidate which is usually looks similar as a point with highlight in a small patch at captured image.
The review for the submission are also built so that we can remove the potential mislabelled data from the participants.

We value your participation.
